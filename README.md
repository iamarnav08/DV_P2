### Running the code

To run the code, you will need to create a local server.

Open the terminal in the directory with the downloaded code. Then run the command-
```
python3 -m http.server port_no
```
 where port_no is the port number you wish to create the server on.

### Navigation the website
The landing page of the website is a dashboard containing a short introduction to the mini-world of the project- Speed-Cubing, with data taken from the official website of the World Cube Assosciation. 

Below the introduction, we have links to the three visualisations we have used and a brief description for each one. For a detailed version of the same, along with a discussion on teh questions being answered by these visualisations, refer to the report present in this repository.

To navigate between the visualisations and teh dashboard, simply use the back and forth buttons given by the browser itself.

### Have fun! Hope you like our work!
